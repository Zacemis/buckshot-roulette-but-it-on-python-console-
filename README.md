At the moment the whole game is in beta test, I'm trying to release updates and bug fixes as often as possible.
Controls:
-In the menu.
-- 1-Start Game
-- 2-Settings
-- 3-Test Tool (hidden)
-In game
-- Select a move with buttons 1 and 2

P.S 
There may be bugs in the game, please inform me about them, so that I can spend less time searching for them and more often release updates.
(Improvements and modifications from the community are welcome).

In the next update:
-2nd round
-Buff items
-Language change
-Big bug fix
